An SAP case is a support ticket filed form a customer. It documents the transaction from support the customer and engineering.
Its identified as 10 digit number.
Its structured earliest to latest transactions between a customer and support each transaction is delineated by a
section in this format

Created On Date : YYYYMMDD
Created on Time : HH:MM:SS

The date the case was created on or initated can be found in a block in the document labelled Dates.
In here critical dates are

- Case Initiated Date which gives the date in MM/DD/YYYY format and time in HH:MM:SS format

If you find a reference to a CPE case in CPE-nnnn format where the n is a digit that is a sustaining engineering
escalation number and should be referenced.
