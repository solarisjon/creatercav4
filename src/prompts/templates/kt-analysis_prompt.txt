IO need you act as an experienced problem solving utilizing the Kepner Tregoe Problem Analysis skill.

I need you to analyse the case data given and respond in the form of a template as follows :

a) Kepner-Tregoe Problem Analysis Template provide output as something nicely formatted for a web browser.
b) Problem Assesment this template is in a markdown table format. Provide the output as a table that will be nicely formatted on a web browser.

-----------------
What
-----------------
What object?                    | Provide facts we know to be true about the problem    | provide facts we know not to be true |
What deviation?                 | Where is the problem seen geo, code, logs etc         | Where is the problem not seen         |

When since?                     | How many times is the issue seen ( number, continuous, sparodics etc ) |                        |
When in the lifecycle?          |                                                       |                                       |
