## DETAILED ANALYSIS SECTIONS:

### KEPNER-TREGOE PROBLEM ANALYSIS

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Clearly define what is happening
- Describe the deviation from expected behavior
- Outline the effects and business impact

#### 2. Problem Specification (IS/IS NOT Analysis)

| Dimension | IS (Facts about the problem) | IS NOT (Facts that distinguish) |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **WHAT** | | |
| Object affected | [What system/component is affected] | [What systems are NOT affected] |
| Deviation observed | [Specific symptoms/errors seen] | [What symptoms are NOT seen] |
| **WHERE** | | |
| Geographic location | [Where problem occurs] | [Where problem does NOT occur] |
| System location | [Which nodes/components] | [Which nodes/components unaffected] |
| **WHEN** | | |
| First occurrence | [When first observed] | [When it was NOT happening] |
| Pattern/frequency | [How often it occurs] | [When it does NOT occur] |
| Lifecycle timing | [At what stage it happens] | [Stages where it doesn't happen] |
| **EXTENT** | | |
| Number of objects | [How many affected] | [How many NOT affected] |
| Size/scope | [Scale of impact] | [Areas NOT impacted] |
| Trend | [Is it getting worse/better] | [What trends are NOT observed] |

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **Potential Causes**: List all possible causes
- **Cause Validation**: Evidence supporting/refuting each cause
- **Root Cause**: The fundamental cause identified
- **Contributing Factors**: Other factors that enabled the problem

#### 4. Solution Development
- **Immediate Actions**: Quick fixes or workarounds
- **Long-term Solutions**: Permanent fixes
- **Implementation Plan**: Steps, timeline, resources needed
- **Risk Assessment**: Risks of proposed solutions

#### 5. Prevention Strategy
- **Process Improvements**: Changes to prevent recurrence
- **Monitoring Enhancements**: Early detection capabilities
- **Training Needs**: Knowledge gaps to address

### RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
- Prioritized action items
- Ownership assignments
- Timeline for completion
- Success metrics
