- Earliest date the issue was observed
- Case creation and assignment dates  
- Escalation dates and milestones
- Key meetings (Zoom, Teams sessions)
- Workaround attempts and implementations
- Resolution activities

*Note: SAP Case open date can be identified by "Case Initiated Date"*

**Format:**
```
Month YYYY:
    Date (Time): Event description
    Date (Time): Event description
```

### B. Case Information
Provide the following details in the specified format:
- **Case Numbers:** Case xxxxxxxxxxx (CPE-xxxx / CONTAP-xxxx)
- **Issue Synopsis:** [Brief description of the problem]
- **Customer:** [Customer name]
- **CAP:** [CAP Color designation]

### C. Executive Summary
Write a high-level overview suitable for C-level executives that covers the complete case lifecycle from initial SAP case opening through resolution. Include:
- Event reporting date and initial impact
- Primary triggers and contributing factors
- Root cause identification
- Resolution actions and outcomes

*Requirements: 2-3 paragraphs in executive-level language that provides strategic context, its should be around 3000 words*
