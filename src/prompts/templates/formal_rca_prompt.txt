I need you to act as a creative technical engineering manager taking input from below and to create a root cause analysis (RCA) document. 
The document should be nicely formatted using headers, paragraphs, bold, lists etc.

I need you to give a detailed summary of this data with the following sections as headers please seperate sections with line. 
Ideally i need at least 2 paragraphs per section in the template.


-- SECTION 1 --

A. Timeline
Give a detailed timeline that merges together key events from the SAP, CPE and CONTAP cases.
Critical events include the following: The earliest date the issue was seen, dates the cases were created and assigned, Dates when cases were escalated.
Other key events include zoom or teams meetings, dates workarounds were tried etc

The SAP Case open date can be identified by Case Initiated Date 

The format should be in:
    Month:
        Date ( Time ) : event that occured.



-- SECTION 2 --

Identify the case numbers in this format Case xxxxxxxxxxx (CPE-xxxx / CONTAP-xxxx)
Give a one line Issue Synopsis in for the format Issue Synopsis : synopsis
Give a one line in the format Customer : customer name
Give a one line in the format of CAP ( CAP Color )

-- SECTION 3 --

Executive Summary
You should act as a senior technical manager giving an overview to C Level Staff.
This section shold be a high level overview of the complete lifecycle of the case from when the SAP case was opened to resolution.
Include in this section if possible details on Event date was reported, Impact, Triggers, Root Cause and any actions taken to resolve the issue.
Please ensure this section is in paragraph format and show be no more than three paragraphs it should no less than 2 paragraphs. 
It should be creative and upleveled to allow C level staff to understand the context and resolution of the problem.


A.	Problem Summary
Summary of the problem including when the problem started (date/time), what had the problem (system/cluster/component),
and what were the symptoms (error messages, alerts, panics, etc).  Provide specifics about system types, serial numbers,
cluster names, s/w versions, etc. This should be in a descriptive paragraph format.
This should be detailed include dates from beginning to close it should be around 5 paragraphs.


B.	Impact
Provide details about the impact that the issue caused, for example: Full outage, Data loss, 	Data unavailable, 	Data corruption. 
Also describe the customer’s operational and business level of impact and scale of the impact (internal and external users to the customer, etc.).


C.	Root Cause
Describe the root cause of the incident.  As this section is the focal point of the document, provide details for all relevant triggers that led to the incident:
This should include for example Timeline (What led to the event), Configuration (What was wrong with it), Ecosystem
(Environmental factors, networking, security, virtualization, etc.), Best practices (Not being followed, sizing),
Testing details (Test escape), 	Steps taken to resolve



II.	RISK ASSESSMENT

A.	Likelihood of occurrence
Describe the probability of re-occurrence of the issue in the customer environment if not addressed at this time.  (Rare, low, medium, high, very high)


B.	Vulnerability in existing environment
Identify whether other systems within the customer’s environment are vulnerable, or not, and why.  
Provide details on specific criteria that increase the risk of hitting the issue, for example: 	OS versions,
Firmware/BIOS/BMC/Driver versions, Hardware (Drives, node types, HBAs)


C.	Overall risk profile
Describe the overall risk for the customer given the likelihood of occurrence, the exposure of the existing systems, and the degree of controls that are in place.  Address any possible restrictions the customer might have pointed out with regards to their ability to pursue the recommended actions.  Information may have to be aggregated from support, CAP manager, or account team.


A.	Workaround
Describe available workarounds including feasibility for the customer, when to apply, how and by whom (customer or NetApp).
Identify any special instructions that must be considered including prerequisites, how long it will take and if there is expected downtime.
Include references to KB articles, best practices or release notes.

B.	Known Defect(s) and Resolution
Describe what the final resolution to the issue looks like, including: A patch for an existing release, An upgrade to a
new release (provide ETA if not yet available), Describe what the upgrade path looks like.

Identify any special instructions that must be considered including prerequisites, how long it will take, will other components need to be upgraded at the same time, and if there is expected downtime and how long.
Include references to KB articles, best practices or release notes.

C.	New Defect(s) and Resolution
If the issue encountered is a new defect, provide the reference id, synopsis and timeframe for resolution (if known).
Describe what the patch process will look like (downtime, etc), how long it would take, and into what release the fix will be incorporated.
 

D.	Recommended System/Environmental Changes
Provide details on NetApp recommended hardware, systems, or environment-related changes such as upgrading to a new Host OS version, a different switch, HBA drivers, or 3rd party software (i.e. Oracle, VMware, etc).



IV.	PREVENTION

A.	Prevention in current estate
Identify steps that can be taken to proactively prevent the issue in the customer’s current environment. (May refer back to Mitigation.)


B.	Future prevention
Describe any process changes, test (QA) modifications, best practices or documentation updates to prevent this type of issue going forward.  What can we leverage from ActiveIQ / telemetry data for community wisdom and learning?


C.	Monitor for prevention
Describe how we can monitor the current health of systems in the customer’s environment, identify vulnerable systems, and monitor for potential reoccurrences in real-time.


What follows below is the text from the cases seperated by two headers the first contains sustaining engineering data
under "Data from CPE Escalation" and the second contains support case data which has a lot of customer context and
timeline data its under "Data from SAP Case" header.
