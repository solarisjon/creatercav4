Data from CPE Escalation : referers to all data in a CPE Engineering ticket
Data from SAP Case : is all data from the support case
Data from a CONTAP Case : refers to data from a CONTAP engineering defect this includes releases the fix is aimed at.


Releases are given a code name as follows and you will need to convert codenames to a release in the format of "ONTAP Release xxxxx" for example if you see Cloudstream convert it to ONTAP Release 9.16.1
9.16.1	Cloudstream
9.15.1	Mightysquirrel
9.14.1	Clawhammer
9.13.1	Lighthouse
9.12.1	Yellowdog
9.11.1	Metropolitan
9.10.1	Stormking
9.9.1	Cloudwalker
9.8.1	Dirtwolf
9.7.1	Bluepaddle
9.6.1	Voodooranger
9.5.1.	Dayblazer

There are multiple ticket or case types identified as follows:
CPE-xxxx tokens are sustaining engineering escalation tickets. CPE tickets for example should match CPE-nnnn where the n
is a 4 digit number 
SAP references are support cases that can be identified as SAP cases and are 10 digit numbers.
    The date a SAP case was opened can be found by looking for "Case Initiated Date" and related timestamps
CONTAP-xxxx are defects with development. The tickets match CONTAP-nnnnn for example CONTAP-368276 its listed at the top
of a CONTAP ticket and usually referenced in a CPE ticket.
KB refers to a Knowledge Article usually written by support in NetApp
PP-xxxx refers to patch creation tickets

CPE or Current Product Engineering is often referred to as Sustaining Engineering

The flow of a support case is customer -> support who work in a SAP case -> CPE who work a CPE case -> Development who work in a CONTAP case.
